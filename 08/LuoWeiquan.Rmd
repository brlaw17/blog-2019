1. **Describe the difference between formats png, svg, and pdf. State your sources with (working!) links (take a look at the RMarkdown cheatsheet for RStudio to learn how to make working links). Make one plot in ggplot2 and save it (using R code) in each of the three file formats you discussed. Comment on the differences you observe in their usage.**

* the following is my little experiment.
```{r echo=T, message=FALSE, results="hide", eval=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(magick)
head(iris)
ggplot1 <- ggplot(data=iris) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x= Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width))
ggsave("ggplot1.png", device = "png")
ggsave("ggplot1.svg", device = "svg")
ggsave("ggplot1.pdf", device = "pdf")

```

Table: Comparision between Resulting Graphic foramat


* The [95VISUAL\'s blog](https://www.95visual.com/blog/svg-pdf-jpg-png-whats-the-difference) provides a great comparision between various graphic formats. Within the scope of this blog, the following three graphic formats are discussed. 

|Criterion| Portable Network Graphics (png)| Scalable Vector Graphics (svg)| Portable Document File (pdf)|
|--------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
|Image quality | [Since it is a raster image format, so it made up of a fixed number of  pixels that form a complete image. The image cannot be enlarged without distortion occurring](http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/mapsonline/faq/what-difference-between-png-file-raster-image-and-svg-file-vector-image)|An SVG image can be compressed or stretched without loss of image quality. [A vector image remains crisp and clear at any resolution or size](http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/mapsonline/faq/what-difference-between-png-file-raster-image-and-svg-file-vector-image)|It supports both raster and vector image format.|
|Web pages compatibility|Yes, the PNG format is suitable for web images like logos that you want to include transparency and fading effects |Yes, but not support for transparency|Yes, but not support for transparency|
|Storage size|Because of the size of a PNG file, this format is not recommended for photos as JPG is unless file size is not an issue.|SVG image element files are smaller than if the image were present in a raster format, but if an object in the image contains many small elements, the size of the file can grow very fast| the file sizes are usually smaller than if you saved a document in its native format including its graphic files.|
Table: Summary of Comparision between Graphic foramat

  A cross-check table for comparision from the 95VISUAL is attached at below.
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="file_format_chart.png", out.width = '40%'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://www.95visual.com/sites/default/files/images/inline/file_format_chart.png")
```

2. **Use `magick` functionality to create an image to be used for a hex sticker.**  package `hexSticker` can help you to get started on dimensions of the sticker. **Include all code necessary to produce your sticker.** In case you are using local images, post those in a folder on **your** website and use the URL to link to them.

* the following is my code to generate a hex sticker.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="IFEWBNet.png", out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/WeiquanLuo/WeiquanLuo.github.io/raw/master/IFEWBNet.png")
```
